	<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">It had been two long weeks since Julienne had been taken under suspicion of witchcraft, and no word had come from the Church. Whenever Nicolas would ask about his mother, Iehan would reassure him that hearing nothing was a good sign, and he would encourage Nicolas to pray with him. They prayed every night, every morning, every meal, every time they missed her presence. The two had been able to work the farm again without her, though the work was hard on Nicolas. No hand was ever empty on the farm before, and that was twice as true now, though the young boy could never do as much as his father. With the weather being so uncooperative over the last year, their crop demanded far more care than in years before, and little Nicolas gave everything he could. The two slept little, and every day they heaved and ached their way into numbness, succumbing to their bodiesâ€™ protests long after the sun had set.<br><br>
	One day, in a moment of distraction, Nicolas struck a heavy stone with the old sickle, and the blade was bent horribly. He was ashamed that he had slowed their work, and he feared what his father would think. Before he had a chance to do anything, however, his father came to his side. Iehan was naturally displeased, but secretly, he had been awaiting an opportunity to go into town. The two decided to prepare the cart for the next day, and then they turned in early. That night was their first full night of rest, and it felt glorious. They rose with the sun, and they were off before it could even crest the tree line. <br><br><br><br></p></div>
