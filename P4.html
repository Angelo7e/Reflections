	<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">When their cart pushed into view of the city, Nicholas was all excitement, and Iehan lovingly asked that he settle himself. While Nicolas was able to control his bouncing about in the wagon, he certainly did not stop the chatter, making sure to comment on nearly everything of note. Iehan didn’t mind; it was nice to see the boy in such high spirits. Once they had made it into the city proper, Nicolas began to scour the shops and farmer’s stalls that lined the central strip looking for their preferred blacksmith, but it was hard to see into any of them through the thick crowds. Not having any luck, Nicolas stared further up the strip, until he noticed the Western tower of the Church and its many spires standing tall over the city. Nicolas promptly laid back in the wagon, his excitement sapped by unwelcome memories. <br><br>
The blacksmith was incredibly busy, but Iehan had always been a faithful customer and it was a simple job, so he promised he’d get to the sickle next thing. In the meantime, the pair would have to wait. It had been quite some time since Iehan had been free to roam in the city, as the family would usually have obligations following the church services that they came for. They were regular attendees once upon a time, but with the weather being so much colder than years past, working on the Sabbath became a necessity for any family who lived off the land. He decided to visit the local tavern, that way he could hear the news over a nice glass of English wine, the premier import of the day. <br><br>
Nicolas had never been to a tavern, but Iehan didn’t trust a lone boy’s safety in the city for a moment. Nicolas followed his father through the door, and they entered a hazy wooden building with cobbled pillars dotting the walls. The room wasn’t packed, but most tables were occupied by a handful of people. On a small stage in the far corner of the room, a man stood reading a billfold, the latest publication from the Church’s private press. The two took their seats at the bar and paid for their drinks; a nice red for the father, and a water for the boy. Nicolas tried to mimic his father’s savoring sips, and as they relaxed, they began to listen.<br><br>
“…and harvests continue to suffer across les terres de France, Allamagne, et l'Espagne, which is causing trouble for peoples across the nations. The town of Arras has just made its first contributions to the purging of the sorceresses suspected to be behind all this, what with the these storms and dreadful dips in temperature. One has been burned at the stake, and another three are under interrogation. As the holy Father says, the greatest way to root out the witch infestation is through their ilk, as the witchfolk are without morals, and will volunteer their comrades if they believe it will save them. As always, my dear citizenry, ma chère famille, do not hesitate to report to the clergy directly, should you—"<br><br>
“It’s all nonsense, and you all know it!” a man shouted from the rear table. Despite the early hour, he was clearly very intoxicated, his structured speech betrayed by his rosy cheeks. 
“Well then what do you suppose they’re doing, if you’re so smart?” the man next to him asked, clearly trying to egg him on.<br><br>
“Church needs someone to blame, ‘at way the people don’t get too rowdy. Weather’s turned for the worse, ‘ats true, but it it’s happenin’ everywhere like it is, seems to me it’s direct from God himself.” The man seemed awful pleased to have spoken his piece, as he crossed his arms and reclined. “Them poor women’s as much a witch as I am, and I’d like to see them try and put a finger on me.”<br><br>
“And what if the Father heard you?” This was a new speaker, another man at the bar. He was a fellow farmer, as shown by the worn hems of his sleeves and the staining around the cuff. A small cross hung from the wrist that held his drink. A thin smile worked across his bright red lips. “What if, by chance, he were to hear of this? Might he suspect… your daughter? Your wife? Careful what you say, good sir. I shudder at the thought.” He chuckled to himself, then took another swig. A chill swept across the room, and all were silent. After a moment, the orator on stage cleared his throat and began again, though he had the sense to choose a new topic.<br><br>
The Father and Son rose from their seats and quickly exited. Though it seemed to have passed, they didn’t need any more reminders. They spent the rest of their wait picking up a few odds and ends for the homestead.<br><br><br><br></p></div>
