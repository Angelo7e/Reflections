	<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">It had been about two hours since Iehan had sent Nicolas to bed, and he knew that there was no way the boy could still be awake in the house. Thus, he set about his true plan. He put his full attention into quietly collecting his horse, saddling him to the wagon once again, and setting off into the night. With how deeply that boy sleeps, there was little concern of him waking before morning. Iehan remarked that he missed this particular blessing of youth; of course, young Nicolas had already made it to the Church himself. The journey is much quicker on horseback, such that Iehan would reach the Church within the time of half an hour, though he did not want to go at a rate that would arouse any more than passing notice. Of course, it would be faster without the wagon, but he wanted somewhere for Julienne to hide should the need arise. He was tense, incredibly so, as his mind raced with the possibilities of what would happen if he got her out. They would go to the farm, pick up Nicolas, and together they would set out for the border. They would head for the Holy Roman Empire, or maybe Spain, or even England. They would go by a new name, and he had enough funds to buy a meager sum of land. It would be hard, but he knew how to work land, trade livestock, and build a life. He was still weighing the possibilities when he arrived, and he stored the cart beside the church. By this time, the city was still, and there was little concern of anyone taking note.<br><br>
	It was at this moment that Iehan realized he had no idea what he was about to experience, and he began to shake. What was he willing to do to get her out? How would he even realize. Then, as though struck, he remembered the sickle. He was going to get Julienne out. He didnâ€™t care what it cost. He grabbed the piece of equipment and held it close, doing his best to conceal the blade with his shabby overcoat.<br><br> 
This never would have held up in the day, but in the vacant night, he slipped into the church unseen. He walked carefully, hugging the wall on the righthand side, ready to hide at the slightest sound. He scanned the pews, the walls, the doorways, until his eyes fell into a darkened stairway that was missing its lantern. When he was close, he could see a distant light at the very bottom, and heard the faintest of voices far above, muffled by wood and stone. He cursed the Father under his breath, drew his sickle, and descended into the abyss.<br><br><br><br>
