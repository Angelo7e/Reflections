<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">“Please, Father, my wife is innocent! Please, you must understand, we have always been a faithful family, Julienne would never do this!” Iehan fell to his knees, his head pressing heavily into the floorboards, teeth gritting after each sentence. Julienne, still restrained by the arms and gagged about the mouth, cried out for him as she was pulled through the doorway, her green eyes locking with his. She had been taken from them. Iehan looked out after them, and seeing nothing but the forested night, he returned his gaze to the massive frame of Father du Guet and his holy tome. “Please… Please Father, you know it’s true.”<br><br>
	“Julienne will be returned if she is found to be innocent, Iehan. If she has truly no relation to the devil, no mark of Satan on her body, no vile corruption in her blood, then you have nothing to fear. Now compose yourself, good man, and maintain your dignity. For your child, sir, if not yourself.” The priest shot a glance at the young boy standing in the doorway at the back of the room. The boy was named Nicolas, and though he was frightened by the commotion, he had slowly worked up the courage to come out. He clenched his hands at his sides, his right firmly grasping a small corn husk doll that his mother had woven for him, his face wrenched in a rigid sob, with a quivering lip and flowing tears. The boy strained against himself, watching in confusion and fury.<br><br> 
	Nicolas locked eyes with his father, Iehan, and though there was compassion in his warm, auburn gaze, he saw it vanish the moment the Father began to leave. Iehan began to beg again, clinging onto the white robes, only to be knocked free by the heavy strike of the Priest’s book. Blood dripped from his mouth as he regained his senses.<br><br>
	“Iehan. Control yourself,” the Holy Father said as he wiped the flecks of blood from the cover. His tone was cold and flat. Iehan wanted to grapple with the fabric once again, to give everything to stop the Father, to fight if he had to— but he had Nicolas. He wasn’t alone, in suffering and in consequence, and so he stowed the impulse. With that, the door slammed shut, and only the receding cries of Julienne could be heard in the stillness. Before long, even that was gone. Finally, Iehan addressed the boy.<br><br>
	“Come here, Nicolas. Help your père up.” <br><br>
	Nicolas wiped his face with his nightshirt and hurried to his dad’s side. He helped guide him to the table and into a chair. Nicolas grabbed him a rag from the kitchen, then sat across from him. His chest barely rose above the table’s edge, given that he was only a boy of eight years old. He sat with arms stretched across the table, his head hung such that his golden hair hid his green eyes, the same as his mother’s. Iehan grabbed a dark bottle from the table and took a deep drink before turning his attention back to Nicolas.<br><br>
	“It’ll be alright, mon fils. Your mother is a pious woman, never done wrong by the church. Du Guet knows that.” He smiled, but there was nothing relaxed about it. It faded quickly.<br><br> 
	“When will they bring mère back?” Nicolas fiddled with the doll as he spoke.<br><br> 
	“I don’t know. God willing, it’ll be soon. Come here, Nicolas, give me a hug.” Nicolas hopped from the chair and grabbed him tightly. “In a year, mon fils, you’ll hardly remember she was ever gone. She loves you, and I love you. This family’s too good to go anywhere.” Nicolas relaxed in his father’s arms, and quietly, the two were able to rebuild a small sliver of hope in one another. But neither mind was put to rest. <br><br>
	Iehan just couldn’t understand why his family was targeted. He knew they had done everything right, the textbook faithful family. The poor man’s thoughts were racing, trying to gauge the likelihood of every outcome, both good and bad. At the same time, Nicolas couldn’t shake the image of the Father, his severe features, and the violence of his actions. It was nothing like the man he had seen in sermons past, leading the chants and prayers of the crowd. The warming smile that had once made young Nicolas feel so welcomed was lost in the hungry maw of the man that had visited their home that night. No matter how he tried to break it down, he couldn’t understand why the good Father would take his mother from him; but the young boy knew it was best not to trouble Iehan with such questions. For now, he would have to wait.<br><br><br><br>
