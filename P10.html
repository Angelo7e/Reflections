	<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">“Fear not, my dear Nicolas. This is a difficult test, but you shall pass. You are the light of the Lord, and though shall not fear what thy God demands of you.” Nicolas could feel the toothy grin hovering over him, could sense the wide-stretched eyes watching in the ultimate anticipation. “Do it boy! Do it! Burn the heretics! Burn the witches! Do it, my dear Nicolas!” <br><br>
This broke through. Nicolas felt his words, and with the thrumming in his chest aligning with the audience, his absolute rage began to come forward. Nicolas felt his pain as burning heat, rising within him. He felt all the frustration of not understanding, every moment he lay awake thinking about the night she was taken, what the devil himself had made from the flesh of the woman he loved most, he felt nothing but unrequited hate. The darkness of the night, thirst for blood that had invaded his quiet life, the power the Father commanded, he rejected it all with every bit of his body. He wanted to be free from fear, free from this suffering, free from the life that had brought him here. He looked at the torch. He looked at the people, all eyes set directly on him. He knew what he had to do.<br><br>
And so, from the hand of the child, the first torch fell, followed by a wave of cries and torches and sticks and cheers. He felt exhilaration, a rush flow through him, the energy of the dancing crowd, moving and crawling and fighting in the light of the pyre, a sea of holy worship in its purest form. <br><br>
“And by the grace of God, we reject the grasp of the abyss! Praise be unto his name!”<br><br>
The people began to chant, and dear little Nicholas chanted with them. He did not look away. He did what he had to do, and they loved him for it. He wanted more, more of the energy, more of the pride, more of their love. If spreading fire could master the dark, could burn away his fear, then he never wanted to be without it. Nicolas threw the doll into the fire. Father du Guet stood in awe, then took him in an embrace. A smile crept across the boy’s face, and those little green eyes were filled with flame.<br><br><br><br>
