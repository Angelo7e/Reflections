	<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">“Exactly, Nicolas, you’ve got it exactly. We must be careful who we trust, for the Witches’ mark cannot be so easily found, and they are cunning by nature. It is no fault that one does not recognize a Witch, no matter how close they are. That is precisely why we must be ever vigilant, and why it can be so difficult to prove one’s guilt. Magic is a fickle thing, you see, and not easily traceable, but the truth of God and the Malleus Maleficarum is undeniable, do you see, child?” <br><br>
He gestured to the Malleus open before them, in which there was an illustration of the dreaded witches’ Sabbat, a festival of fornication, devilry, sacrifice, and dance. Bestial forms danced in the trees; unnaturally proportioned bodies writhed in blood-soaked lust. Headless forms hung from the trees, their separated visages staring from the heart of the fire. Nicolas felt sick. It was only a drawing, but he couldn’t bear to look any longer. He closed the book, and contained a retch. When he had gathered himself, he responded.<br><br>
“But my Mama would never do that, she never killed anybody, she took care of me. She was always with me and father, every night. She never did that, we would know.”<br><br>
	A grin crept across du Guet’s face. “My dear Nicolas, such are the tricks of witchery. We have apprehended many damnable witches, your mother is not the first, nor are you the first to be deceived. Those who came before listed her as among their number, and after we revealed her true form, she told us herself.”<br><br>
	“I… I don’t believe you! She wouldn’t! Not ever!” Nicolas shook his head violently, as though trying to knock the consideration from his mind. Du Guet grabbed the boys head and looked directly into his eyes, and with the toothiest grin the boy had ever seen, eyes blazing, he asked a simple question.<br><br>
	“Would you like me to show you?”<br><br>
	“Y-yes. I don’t believe you.”<br><br>
	“Okay, my dear Nicolas, but be warned. You will not soon forget this, for we are walking into the mouth of hell. Do you understand?”<br><br>
	“I do.” He didn’t.<br><br>
	“Wonderful.”<br><br>
	Father du Guet took the boy by the hand and led him down the stone stairs, and he placed the lantern the boy had borrowed back on its hook. The pair descended lower and lower, further down than the child had ever thought the structure could go. The boy remarked a growing, unpleasant smell. The two continued until they came to a heavy iron door with cushioning around its border, set to contain sound. <br><br>
	“Are you ready, dear Nicholas?” <br><br>
	“Yes.” He wasn’t.<br><br>
	The Father inserted the key, but with his push into the slot, the door swung open freely, the padding scraping quietly across the ground. The two were hit with a wave of stench, the unmistakable smell of rot. The boy coughed and held his hands to his mouth and nose, his eyes beginning to water. The Father looked at Nicolas and motioned for silence. He somehow seemed wholly unaffected, and Nicolas tried to mimic his apparent disregard for the olfactory assault. Before them was a long, dark hallway, with a dim light illuminating strange, hazy shapes at the far end. Nicolas tucked behind the Father, holding the doll close, just as the Father held the Malleus. Together, they breached the darkness. Their footsteps, despite their delicate gait, still echoed lightly off the stone walls as they went. As they approached the light, Nicolas began to make out the space before him and gasped. Father du Guet clamped a hand onto the boy’s mouth. The Father’s eyes were wide, and he motioned for silence.<br><br>
	Before them was an inverted sea of dangling feet, dried blood running from pointed toes, some still dripping. It was dark above, but he could see that many of the bodies were heavily disformed, split, opened, or broken in a variety of ways. Flesh hung freely at every turn, though the manner of disfiguration was anything but consistent. The boy screwed his eyes shut, and he clenched his teeth tight. The pit opening beneath his stomach was widening by the second, and that feeling of sickness spread throughout his body. He didn’t want to keep walking, but he had to see her. His mother could never fit in a place like this. He couldn’t believe it, she wasn’t.  He felt the Father tense and brace himself, and he looked past the man to see the bleeding body of a man, hacked and slashed wildly on the floor before a cell that was wide open. He could see a figure in the darkness of the cell, splayed on some apparatus, but the light from the walls did not extend that far. The Father slowly inched forward, ever closer to the end of the hall and into the room. He tensed more and more with every step, pulling his hand free from the boy’s. Nicolas stopped and watched the priest walk, whose arms were raised in preparation. <br><br>
	The moment the Father reached the corner, there was a terrible cry as a black form shrouded in bloody, torn cloth flew from the doorway and onto du Guet. Nicolas winced and stepped back as he saw the shining flash of a sickle arc straight for Father du Guet’s neck. The Father was ready, and he jerked his arm up, catching the biting edge deep in his forearm. He struck the man across the face, and due to their difference in size, the man was sent reeling, sprawled across the floor before Nicolas. The man tried to stand, but his left arm and leg appeared nearly useless, damage from the previous fight. He looked up, and the two sets of eyes met.<br><br>
	“Nicolas?!” His horrified voice shrieked, his body shaking with the shout, and as he clambered to his feet, Nicholas could only back away. He felt that he would wretch at any moment, that he couldn’t bear the idea of the mangled body and mass of blood-matted hair was that same father he knew and loved. Iehan turned to face du Guet, momentarily forgetting himself in the shock of meeting his child here, in the one place he’d wished he’d never see. It was too late. The book came down again, a resounding crack echoing up the tunnel and into the night. Iehan was down. Blood poured from his mouth and eye, the socket of which had been broken. Iehan limply attempted to lift himself, but his senses were far too scattered.<br><br>
	“Geh awee frum mai shun!” flew from him mouth in a mist of red, speech rendered incomprehensible by the damage. A final strike came from the hulking man, and Iehan was no longer present. His consciousness had temporarily escaped him.<br><br>
Nicolas was reeling. His body ran cold, but his face and hands were on fire, and finally, he began to vomit. He began tears fell from his eyes, but he did not sob. The Father Tore a portion of his robe, pulled the sickle from his arm, and tied the fabric tightly above the wound. Then, he returned to the boy, and led him onward.<br><br>
“That was ta père, an unexpected guest. I should have known; devil worship can spread within a family faster than the pox. It’s a miracle, dear Nicolas, that you escaped such a fate. No doubt they would have converted you as well when you were old enough. It is truly by the grace of God that this plot was uncovered, and should you still not believe me, little lamb, this is your mother.” He held the lantern aloft, and the light poured over the figure before them.<br><br>
The elongated form before them did not react, did not respond. Its limbs had been stretched and broken on the wheel, its skin torn from the stretching in a number of places. The flesh of the face was beyond recognition. Only one green eye could open, and it locked onto Nicholas. That same green eye that he carried a pair of. That same loving, caring, watchful green that had protected him through every dreadful thing that had ever come upon their family. What was it doing in this thing? <br><br>
“That is not mon mère.” He whimpered.<br><br>
“This is what she has become.”<br><br>
“That is not mon mère!” He shrieked, planting his face in the stone, fist striking. “No! No! It isn’t!” He was sobbing uncontrollably, the small doll held closer than it ever had been. <br><br>
“My boy, this is the darkest truth of our reality. That is not ta mère, but it was, before the devil got to her. Now, in this light of such miraculous events, we must prepare! God himself has called for their death, through your light, my dear Nicholas! Let us prepare!” He plucked the boy from the floor and held him, carrying him from the bloody scene. They rushed up the stairs, the man bristling with excitement, the child quivering in his arms, threatened by everything and yet saved by the hand of the man he had hated. He sat the boy in the front of the main hall, under the silver statue, and he told him to wait. The man then rushed into the other tower, awakening the first of his clergymen, then commanding them to do the same. Soon, all was motion, the street was growing louder and louder by the minute.<br><br>
The boy took little notice, sitting limply, staring into the tortured face of the statue. Even in the light of the holiest place in his little world, the only thing that grabbed his heart was the overwhelming darkness of it all. The pain of what he’d seen, the grief of losing his mother, the betrayal of his murderous father, the discovery of the true form of a witch. If that was true, maybe it all was. Maybe he had been deceived. Maybe he had been saved. If only the boy had been a little older, when he could understand the true terrors he had witnessed. The real fear that comes with coercion, forced confession, and hysteria. Instead, the boy was left defenseless to the evils of a world that had lost its sense, and what he knew could never explain the twisted ideas of the Malleus Maleficarum. <br><br>
He didn’t take note when they brought the figures out of the dungeon. He didn’t care when the people started to flood in. He barely even felt the hands of the Father, coming to carry him once again. He only really took note when he recognized the scene before him. There the two were, his battered father, his deformed mother, tied to the pyres like ragdolls clad in filth. Around their bases, the people swarmed, throwing sticks onto the mass and shouting in excitement. The Father pushed effortlessly to the front, and held the boy high, for all to see.<br><br>
“Ce garçon is the face of God, the example of his light. Had he not come to me out of the good grace of his heart, we might never have caught this damnable addition to the cadre of witches that have plagued us for so long. Now, watch as this little lamb casts the first flame unto the fire, to send the creatures back into the abyss and to purify their hosts in the swelling heat.” That pulled Nicholas back into reality and sent a shiver down his coiled spine. Before he knew it, he had been placed before them, the twin pyres of his parentage, a torch in one hand and the doll in the other. Iehan was just returning to consciousness, but Julienne was not so fortunate. She stared into the eyes of her child, and though she had not the physical ability to emote, the tears flowed from her good eye, with guttural cries working out of her throat. The crowd mocked her strained cries, a sea of sound swallowing sympathy. <br><br><br><br>
