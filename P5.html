	<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">On the journey home in the afternoon, Iehan drove the wagon and Nicolas lay in the back with their purchases, admiring the new edge on the old sickle. It was as nice a day as they could hope for, with the sun’s light shining over golden fields and busy hands. The air carried a cooling breeze, a refreshing accompaniment to the season of harvest. When they were most the way home, they saw a familiar face waving them down up ahead. The man was Old George, a man who had been childhood friends with Nicolas’ grandfather, and he owned the neighboring land. The boy was excited to see him, and he stood behind his father, waving back to the man. As they got closer, however, it became apparent that George was not quite so pleased. Slowly, Nicolas lowered his arm, instead grabbing onto his father’s shoulder. Iehan put a hand on Nicolas’. <br><br>
	“What’s got you so worked up George?”<br><br>
	“It’s Father du Guet. He, uh, he came looking for you himself.” Nicolas felt his father tighten. “I’m so sorry. The date’s been set, three days’ time, at midday. Her and some other girls from the county, stand accused of calling the storms that plagued us all year. Now the other girls, I don’t know about, and I know it isn’t your Julienne that’s been doing it, but… She confessed, Iehan.” <br><br>
	Nicolas fell back into the wagon, stunned. Iehan didn’t speak, he simply spurred the horse on, and they rode away in silence. Nicolas watched the sky pass above him. His father did the very same. As they got further and further away, George called after them, offering help should they need it. Iehan raised his hand in acknowledgement, but he hadn’t really heard George. Neither of them had.<br><br>
		When they got home, they took care of the horse, set away the wagon, and set about making dinner without a sound or a look from either. They had planned to make a pot-au-feu to conclude their unusual day, a steamed beef stew that is much loved in the winter-times, but the festivity was no longer present. As they sat on either end of the table, Iehan quickly began to eat, the drops of broth clinging gently to his wiry beard. Nicolas vacantly stared into the brown contents of his bowl.<br><br>
	“Eat.” <br><br>
	Nicolas did not.<br><br>
	“Eat, garçon.”<br><br>
	Nicolas did not eat.<br><br>
	Iehan slammed his fist into the table’s edge, shaking the frame and sending a jolt through Nicolas, who started wolfing down the food faster than could be comfortable, wincing at the heat. He didn’t set the wooden bowl down again until it was empty, and when he did, he could see the water threatening to fall from his father’s eyes, the shimmering in the lamplight. He took a breath and steadied himself, bracing his hands on his knees, looking away from his son.<br><br>
	“You know what George meant?” Iehan asked.<br><br>
	“Yes.” <br><br>
	“Ta mère… Julienne… She isn’t coming back.” They faced each other, and the tears had finally begun to fall, the shakes in his voice threatening to cut the words off in every syllable. Nicolas jumped to his feet, fists trembling at his sides.<br><br>
	“They’re wrong! Mon mère didn’t do that! She didn’t!”<br><br>
	“I know mon fils, I know, but they think she did.”<br><br>
	“Can’t we go get her? Can’t we tell the Father she’s innocent?”<br><br>
	“No! They won’t listen to us, not if they got a confe—”<br><br>
	“But she didn’t do it!” Nicolas shrieked. <br><br>
	“It doesn’t matter! If they think she did, that is the law, that is the word of God to those lunatics, and there isn’t a change can be made in their minds! Do you understand that?” Nicolas was clearly hurt, and Iehan was hit with a wave of guilt. “Come.” He held his arms wide.<br><br>
	Nicolas ran into his arms, squeezing tight. “She didn’t do it,” he whimpered.<br><br>
	“I know,” Iehan replied, barely above a whisper. As they squeezed one another, the two silently protested against the cruelty of it. Iehan was wracked by the injustice of the judiciary, the life the church had destroyed, the smallest hope of a favorable ruling now fully extinguished. Silently, Iehan swore to himself, he wouldn’t let his boy lose his mother, and Julienne wouldn’t lose her family. He was going to set her free. In his young mind, Nicolas had only one thought. <br><br>
	I can change their minds.<br><br><br><br>
