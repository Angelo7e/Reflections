	<div><p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;">That night, Iehan sent Nicolas to bed shortly after the sun had set. It was looking to be a particularly bright night, and Iehan claimed he didn’t want to waste it, but said he would join Nicolas in a few hours when he had made up the work for the day. Nicolas entered the house, went to his room, and immediately crawled out the back window. He went into the fields to the rear and followed the road, staying low and out of the light. Once he was sure he was well out of his father’s sight, he began to walk on the main road, his doll in hand.<br><br>
	While they had needed the cart to haul their goods earlier in the day, the town was not an unreasonable walk, especially with the moon’s light to guide him. It would take him at least two hours to walk there, and likely two to get back. By the time his father noticed he was gone, he would have been well into town, if he had not already accomplished his goal. And how could his father be angry, if he returned alongside his mother, safe in hand? He knew that he could do it, could prove to them that she was innocent, because he knew in his heart that she could never do such terrible things. She was no witch, she was no devil, she was his Mama, and he loved her more than even his father. Still, in the darkest corners of his mind, there was doubt. Doubt from his father’s words. Doubt from the terror of the night she was taken. Doubt, because even as he walked the quiet roads to the town, he was so incredibly alone. He pushed the darkness out of his mind and looked down at his feet. His leather shoes striking the packed dirt, all cast in the hazy white of moonlight. If he watched his feet, and made sure they didn’t stop, he’d be there in no time. Through the dark, through the fields, through the woods, past whatever creatures hid in the night, he would reach his destination. And so, he did. When he finally saw the first lights of the city, he lifted his gaze once again.<br><br>
	He had never been through the city streets without his father, but a lone child covered in dirt is not an uncommon sight. No, of the scant few who were still out at that hour, not one paid him much attention. Fortunately for Nicolas, he was very familiar with the path to the Church. <br><br>
	The building seemed much bigger without the crowds of people milling about. Its towers shone in the night, with two imposing doors meeting at their center. On the left side of the building were four pillars of wood, standing tall from a massive pile of kindling at the base. The boy approached, then carefully opened one of the doors. It was heavy, but he slipped inside. The interior of the massive space was gorgeous, with stained glass lining the walls on every side, and dark wooden inscription bordering the central hall. The boy slowly approached the very front of the space, passing pew after pew, until he stood under the weight of the massive statue that hung before him. He swallowed hard, then began to look around. He had been told by his father that the Priest, Father du Guet, lived in the church tower, so when he found the mouth of the staircase on the right side of the church, he knew to ascend. Carefully, he plucked one of the lanterns off the wall, and slowly ascended the stone stairs. When he finally came to a dark wooden door, covered in iron ornamentation, he paused. He was so small next to the massive entryway; he could barely reach the knocker. He looked at the doll in his hand, held it to his chest, and knocked on the door. A groggy voice called back.<br><br>
	“Just a moment! Whoever has come to disturb me at this hour must have quite a good reason, or I assure you, I will—” The door swung wide, and the snarling face of Father du Guet quickly softened when he saw the frightened face looking up at him. “Who are you, little one?”<br><br>
“My parents… Iehan, and Julienne.” <br><br>
“Ah, then you must be… Nicolas, was it?”<br><br>
	The boy nodded.<br><br>
	“What are you doing here, at this hour? And all alone, no less.” <br><br>
	Once again, Nicholas’ gaze fell to his feet, and he took a deep breath before he spoke. “Y-you said mon mère’s a witch, but she isn’t. She didn’t do it, I know she didn’t, and,” he looked back into the man’s piercing, grey eyes, reflecting the boy’s flame in the night, “and I’m gonna prove it to you!”<br><br>
	The man’s face was plastered with pity. “Oh, my dear child, please. Come in. We can speak about your mother.” His voice conveyed a care that confused the boy, but feeling the tension begin to ebb, he followed. The two sat apart by the man’s desk, and they began to discuss the matter of Julienne.<br><br><br><br>
